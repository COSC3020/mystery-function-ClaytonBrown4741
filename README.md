# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}

ANSWER: This function simply goes through an array of numbers and finds the biggest one.  
It does this recursively by splitting up the array into smaller and smaller pieces and then  
comparing those individual pieces to find out which one is the biggest.
